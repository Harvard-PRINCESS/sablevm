Question and Answers
--------------------

1. How do I generate the configure script when building from Subversion?

   ./autogen


2. What are the meaning of the different prefixes used in SableVM
   identifiers?

   _svmt_*: type (usually typedef of a struct)
   _svmv_*: global variable
   _svmf_*: function
   _svmm_*: macro
   _svmh_*: hidden function... A function which should never be called
            directly by a SableVM programmer, it is instead called
            through a macro.  (e.g., if you wish to call a _svmh_
            function, you should find its related _svmm_ macro and call
            it instead).
