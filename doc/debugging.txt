*** SableVM Information about DEBUGGING ***

DEBUGGING VERSION COMPILATION
  --enable-debugging-features - add that option to ./configure call to get
  switched interpreter with all possible checks and verbose options.
  NOTE: This doesn't work with inlined engine (don't force inlined).
  NOTE: Such JVM is much slower than normally.

DEBUGGING PROPERTIES
  sablevm.verbose.methods - when operating on a binary compiled with
  debugging features - setting this property to true outputs names of
  every method that is to be executed.

  sablevm.verbose.instructions - when operating on a binary compiled
  with debugging features - setting this property to  true  outputs
  names of every instruction that is to be executed (WARNING: expect flood!!!)
  NOTE: This requires "debugging features" enabled (See above).

DEBUGGING METHODS
  java.lang.Runtime.traceMethodCalls and java.lang.Runtime.traceInstructions
  help getting smaller traces; you simply modify your program to call these
  methods around the problem spots.
