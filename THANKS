SableVM THANKS file.

SableVM has been initially developed by Etienne M. Gagnon as his
Ph.D. research project, and as a project of the Sable research group
of McGill University.

Etienne is now working as an assistant professor at UQAM, where he
continues to further develop the SableVM project in collaboration with
the McGill-UQAM Sable research group.

Many people have contributed to SableVM by reporting problems,
suggesting various improvements or providing other services.  Here is
